    content: `A polished GitHub profile is an important part of your public identity as a developer. Why? For one thing, it will most likely be the first place that potential employers look to evaluate your skills and professionalism. And it also allows you to connect with and showcase your work to other developers, which can lead to interesting collaborations.
                     A key component of your profile, and one that many new developers overlook, is the README file that's associated with each respository. A README file acts like a virtual storefront to a repositoryâ€”it's the first thing that a person sees when they visit a repo on GitHub. But it's also much more than that: README files contain essential information about the repo's project. Thus, the quality of a README file can differentiate a high-quality repo from a low-quality one.
                     There's no one right way to structure a README file. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very sparse one.`,

    content: `Web development is a fast-changing field. New technologies and advancements appear every day, and web developers need ways to stay apprised of these changes.
                     Learning how to code introduces fledgling developers to multiple new languages and concepts over a short period of time. The amount of mental effort required to understand these concepts often leaves little time to form opinions about them, but part of a successful career in technology includes the ability to express opinions about trends in an informed and passionate way. It's important that new developers start practicing and honing this skill as soon as possible.`,
